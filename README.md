# SOUL-Workshop

This workshop walks through an introduction to SOUL programming, using an example project, building a simple synthesiser.

The course slides are provided [here](./Workshop.pdf)

To join in and write some SOUL code, you might want to get yourself set up with some tools:

- Run SOUL in you browser at [soul.dev/lab](https://soul.dev/lab), where the code is compiled and run in a browser as WASM/Web-audio.
- Live-code patches in a full DAW environment using [Tracktion Waveform](https://www.tracktion.com/products/waveform-free) (v10 or later)
- Use the [SOUL command-line tool](./SOUL_Command.md) to compile and play particular files and patches locally on your machine

There are lots more documents about the language and tools in the [main github repo](https://github.com/soul-lang/SOUL/tree/master/docs).
